Documentation organization Strategy

the technical documentation following industry standards (Diátaxis framework and established patterns).

Common Documentation issues(Duplications)
- redundant files with overlapping content
- scattered information into focused documents
- inconsistencies in configuration examples and commands
- new files created when existing files should be updated

Industry-Standard Structure

Created purpose-driven documentation following the Diátaxis framework:

| Document             | Type         | Purpose                              |
  |----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| getting-started.md   | Tutorial     | Learning-oriented quick start        |
| development-guide.md | How-to Guide | Problem-oriented workflows           |
| api-reference.md     | Reference    | Information-oriented technical specs |
| architecture.md      | Explanation  | Understanding-oriented system design |
| deployment-guide.md  | How-to Guide | Problem-oriented deployment          |
| performance-guide.md | Reference    | Information-oriented optimization    |
| monitoring.md        | How-to Guide | Problem-oriented analytics setup     |
| troubleshooting.md   | Reference    | Problem-oriented solutions           |

Key Improvements

1. Single source of truth for each topic
2. Clear audience targeting for each document
3. Consistent formatting and structure
4. Cross-references between related topics
5. Practical examples with copy-paste code
6. Standardized command references

What You Can Now Do

- Onboard new developers with clear getting-started guide
- Reference component APIs without hunting through multiple files
- Deploy confidently with step-by-step procedures
- Debug efficiently with comprehensive troubleshooting
- Optimize performance with specific targets and tools

The documentation is now maintainable, navigable, and follows industry best practices for technical documentation.
