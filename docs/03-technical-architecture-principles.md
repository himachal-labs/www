# Technical Architecture Principles

## Core Technical Philosophy
Architecture should be invisible infrastructure that enables philosophy, not constrains it.

**The deeper principle**: We're building the cognitive infrastructure for the next century. Our technical architecture must demonstrate we can handle complexity at scale—making it serve humanity rather than overwhelming it.

## Performance Philosophy

### Speed as Trust
**Research Context**: Major sites report 70% user abandonment due to poor performance. Every millisecond of delay contradicts our "complexity translation" promise.

**The agency connection**: When we say "the cost of informed choice approaches zero," that includes time cost. Sub-second performance proves we can deliver augmentation at the speed of thought.

### Performance Targets
- **Time to First Byte**: <200ms globally
- **First Contentful Paint**: <1s
- **Time to Interactive**: <1.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: <0.1
- **Total Page Weight**: <500KB initial load

### Performance Strategies
- **Static First**: Pre-render everything possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core content works instantly, enhancements layer on
- **Resource Prioritization**: Critical path ruthlessly optimized
- **Global Distribution**: Content near users everywhere

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Simplicity Scales**
**Insight**: Stripe manages 15M lines of code through consistent, simple interfaces.

**Application**: 
- Choose boring technology that works
- Prefer proven patterns over novel solutions
- Complexity in implementation, not architecture
- Every abstraction must earn its existence

### 2. **Static Where Possible**
**Research**: Astro delivers 90% less JavaScript for static content. Static sites achieve better Core Web Vitals.

**Principles**:
- Generate at build time, not request time
- Ship HTML, not JavaScript that creates HTML
- Dynamic behavior through enhancement, not requirement
- Server interactions only when truly needed

**Philosophy alignment**: Just as we translate complexity at build time (not runtime) in our products, our website should pre-translate content into immediately usable form.

### 3. **Progressive Web App Capabilities**
**Research**: PWAs show 70% conversion improvements through offline capability and app-like experience.

**Core Features**:
- **Offline First**: Site works after first visit without connection
- **App Shell**: Instant UI through cached shell
- **Progressive Loading**: Content streams in as available
- **Resilient**: Graceful degradation for everything

### 4. **JavaScript Philosophy**
**Principle**: JavaScript enhances, never gates—mirroring how AI augments, never replaces human judgment.

**Guidelines**:
- Core content readable without JavaScript (agency without augmentation)
- Interactions enhanced by JavaScript (augmentation when available)
- Framework overhead justified by clear benefit
- Bundle size budgets strictly enforced

**The parallel**: Users should have agency even without our enhancement, but with it, they think better.

### 5. **CSS Architecture**
**Research**: Modern CSS approaches show 43% higher team productivity with clear systems.

**Approach**:
- **Utility-first acceptable** for rapid development
- **Component styles** for reusable patterns
- **Design tokens** for consistency
- **Progressive enhancement** for modern features

### 6. **Asset Strategy**
**Every byte counts.**

**Optimization Requirements**:
- Images: Modern formats, responsive sizes, lazy loading
- Fonts: Subset, preload critical, fallback stack
- Icons: SVG sprites or inline for performance
- Code: Minified, compressed, cached aggressively

## Infrastructure Principles

### 1. **Build Process**
- **Fast builds** enable rapid iteration
- **Reproducible** across environments
- **Automated optimization** for all assets
- **Clear errors** that guide to solutions

### 2. **Deployment Strategy**
- **Atomic deploys**: All or nothing
- **Instant rollback**: Confidence through safety
- **Global CDN**: Content everywhere
- **Preview deploys**: Test before production

### 3. **Development Experience**
- **Local = Production**: Same behavior everywhere
- **Fast refresh**: See changes instantly
- **Clear errors**: Know what's wrong immediately
- **Accessible tooling**: All team members can contribute

## Data Architecture

### Content Management
- **Git-based** for version control and collaboration
- **Markdown** for portability and simplicity
- **Structured data** where beneficial
- **Build-time validation** for content integrity

### API Philosophy
- **No API is best API**: Static data preferred
- **Build-time fetching** when possible
- **Edge functions** for dynamic needs
- **Graceful fallbacks** for all external data

**The principle**: APIs should be like our AI—invisible infrastructure that surfaces only what matters when it matters.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- **No client secrets**: Everything client-visible is public
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict by default
- **HTTPS everywhere**: No exceptions
- **Minimal attack surface**: Static reduces vulnerabilities

## Monitoring Philosophy

### What to Measure
- **Real user metrics**: Actual experience, not synthetic
- **Error rates**: Target zero (reliability = trust in complexity handling)
- **Performance budgets**: Automated enforcement
- **Accessibility scores**: Continuous validation
- **Time to understanding**: How quickly users grasp our value
- **Agency indicators**: Task completion without confusion

### What Not to Measure
- Vanity metrics without user impact
- Framework-specific measurements
- Synthetic tests replacing real user data

## Technology Selection Criteria

### When Evaluating Options, Consider:

1. **Performance Impact**
   - Bundle size contribution
   - Runtime performance cost
   - Build time impact
   - Caching effectiveness

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Learning curve for team
   - Debugging capability
   - Community support
   - Documentation quality

3. **Future Maintenance**
   - Project health and longevity
   - Upgrade path clarity
   - Breaking change frequency
   - Escape hatch availability

4. **Philosophy Alignment**
   - Supports progressive enhancement (core agency + augmentation)
   - Enables accessibility (cognitive augmentation as human right)
   - Promotes performance (speed = reduced cognitive cost)
   - Encourages simplicity (complexity in service, not structure)
   - Demonstrates translation (makes the complex comprehensible)

## Platform Capabilities to Leverage

### Modern Web Features
- **Service Workers**: Offline, caching, performance
- **Web Components**: Encapsulation where beneficial
- **CSS Grid/Container Queries**: Responsive without JavaScript
- **Native Lazy Loading**: Browser-optimized performance

### Avoid Premature Optimization
- Don't add complexity for theoretical scale
- Measure before optimizing
- Simple solutions often sufficient
- Complexity must prove its value

## Remember
Technology serves the mission. Every technical decision should make it easier to demonstrate that complexity can be translated into clarity. The best architecture is the one users never notice—it just works, fast, everywhere, for everyone.

**The north star**: We're building infrastructure that will define how humans navigate complexity for the next hundred years. Our technical choices should reflect this ambition—not through complexity, but through elegant translation of complexity into usable form.

**The test**: Does our architecture feel like using ChoiceCheck? Complexity handled invisibly, clarity delivered instantly, agency preserved throughout.
