# Content Strategy

## Content Philosophy
Every word should translate complexity into understanding. Content is UX.

## Information Architecture Principles

### Cognitive Load Management
**Research**: Human working memory holds ~7 items. Every additional choice increases abandonment risk.

**Application**:
- Present 3-5 options maximum at decision points
- Group related information clearly
- Progressive disclosure for complex topics
- Clear next steps at every level

### The Two-Click Rule
**Principle**: Any information accessible within two clicks from anywhere.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Flat architecture preferred over deep nesting
- Cross-linking between related content
- Search as escape hatch, not primary navigation
- URL structure that's guessable

## Content Structure

### Page Architecture Pattern

#### Hero Section (7-second understanding)
- One powerful statement (e.g., "Stop guessing. Start knowing.")
- One supporting sentence that expands the promise
- One clear action (primary app download or demo)
- One striking visual (product in context, not abstract)

#### Problem Space (Why this matters)
- Current state pain ("We've all been there...")
- Relatable scenarios (shopping confusion, decision paralysis)
- The hidden complexity (thousands of pages of standards)
- The human cost (defaulting, exhaustion, surrendered agency)

**Key pattern**: Make the invisible visible. Show users the complexity they're already drowning in but haven't articulated.

#### Solution Overview (Our approach)
- Philosophy, not features ("We translate complexity into clarity")
- The crucial distinction ("We don't simplify—we make comprehensible")
- How it works in practice (3 simple steps)
- Personalization promise ("YOUR goals, YOUR needs")

**Key pattern**: Show the same complexity, just navigable. Preserve user agency.

#### Evidence/Products (Proof it works)
- Screenshots with context (actual UI, real results)
- User stories by segment (parents, fitness enthusiasts, health-conscious)
- Specific benefits per segment
- Expansion vision ("Today food, tomorrow everything")

**Key pattern**: Ground the abstract in the concrete. Show actual augmentation.

#### Call to Action (Next step)
- Single, clear action
- Low commitment
- High value
- Immediate possibility

## Content Voice & Tone

### Voice Attributes
- **Clear**: Technical accuracy without jargon
- **Confident**: Assured without arrogance  
- **Warm**: Human without being casual
- **Inspiring**: Future-focused yet practical

### Writing Principles

#### Clarity First
- Short sentences when possible
- Active voice predominant
- Concrete over abstract
- Examples over explanations

**The ChoiceCheck formula**: Problem + Recognition + Solution
- "Overwhelmed by choices" + "Get instant scores" = Clarity
- "No time to research" + "Expert analysis in seconds" = Efficiency

#### Progressive Complexity
- Start with why
- Build to what
- End with how
- Details on demand

#### Inclusive Language
- Assume intelligence, not knowledge
- Define technical terms naturally
- Multiple learning styles supported
- Global audience considered

## Content Types

### Static Content
**Purpose**: Foundational information that rarely changes

**Examples**:
- Company mission
- Product overviews
- Core philosophies
- Legal policies

**Optimization**: Maximum caching, minimal updates

### Expansion Content
**Purpose**: Show the platform potential beyond current products

**Examples**:
- "Coming Soon" sections
- Domain expansion roadmap
- Future vision glimpses
- Platform capabilities

**Key insight**: Users buy into the vision, not just the current product. Show where this leads.

### Dynamic Insights
**Purpose**: Demonstrate thought leadership

**Examples**:
- AI/human collaboration insights
- Industry perspectives
- Product updates
- Future vision pieces

**Approach**: Build-time generation, not runtime

### Micro-Content
**Purpose**: Guide and reassure throughout journey

**Examples**:
- Button labels
- Error messages
- Loading states
- Confirmation messages

**Principle**: Every word matters more in micro-content

## SEO as User Service

### Semantic Structure
- Content organized for humans and machines
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Descriptive meta information
- Structured data where beneficial

### Authority Building
- Demonstrate expertise through depth
- Answer real questions
- Provide unique perspectives
- Build topic clusters

### Technical Excellence
- Fast loading as ranking factor
- Mobile-first as baseline
- Accessibility as SEO benefit
- Clean URL structure

## Content Governance

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: Every claim verifiable
- **Relevance**: Every page serves clear purpose
- **Currency**: Outdated content removed/updated
- **Consistency**: Same terms used throughout

### Review Cycles
- Technical accuracy review
- Brand voice alignment
- Accessibility validation
- Performance impact check

### Success Metrics
- Time to comprehension
- Task completion rate
- Search query analysis
- User feedback themes

## Localization Philosophy

### Principles
- Clarity translates better than cleverness
- Design for global from start
- Cultural sensitivity in examples
- Technical terms consistent globally

### Anti-Patterns
- Idioms and cultural references
- Assumptions about context
- Complex sentence structures
- Ambiguous pronouns

## Content Performance

### Loading Strategy
- Critical content in initial HTML
- Progressive enhancement for rich media
- Lazy loading for below-fold
- Preloading for likely next steps

### Resilience
- Content readable without CSS
- Meaning preserved without images
- Core value without JavaScript
- Offline access after first visit

## The Content Test

### For Every Page, Ask:
1. Can someone understand the value in 7 seconds?
2. Is the next step obvious?
3. Does complexity reveal progressively?
4. Would this make sense to global audience?
5. Does it build trust through clarity?

### For Product Pages, Also Ask:
1. Do we show the problem before the solution?
2. Is the cognitive augmentation tangible, not theoretical?
3. Does personalization feel real, not generic?
4. Is the expansion path credible?
5. Does it feel like restored agency, not another app?

## Remember
Content isn't what we say—it's what people understand. Every word either builds trust or erodes it. Choose wisely.

Great content feels effortless to read but is hard to write. The effort is invisible, the clarity is not.

**The VastSilicon way**: We don't tell people about cognitive augmentation—we let them experience it through progressively revealed understanding. The content itself demonstrates the product philosophy.
