# Start Here: Rebuilding VastSilicon's Web Presence

## Context You Need
You're rebuilding VastSilicon's website from scratch. The current implementation fails to embody the company's core philosophy: "Complexity isn't the problem—it's potential waiting for translation."

## Your Mission
Create a web interface that demonstrates—not just describes—VastSilicon's ability to translate AI complexity into human understanding.

## Document Reading Order

### 1. **Core Philosophy & Objectives** (01)
Understand what we're really building and why. This isn't just a website—it's a philosophy demonstration.

### 2. **Agency Restoration Framework** (08) ← NEW
The central principle that guides everything: restoring human agency where complexity has overwhelmed choice.

### 3. **Design Principles** (02)
Research-backed principles that should guide every visual and interaction decision. Based on insights from Apple, Material Design, Linear, and others.

### 4. **Technical Architecture Principles** (03)
How to think about the technical foundation. Performance, resilience, and simplicity as core requirements.

### 5. **Content Strategy** (04)
How information should be organized and presented. Every word matters.

### 6. **Performance Philosophy** (05)
Why speed isn't just a metric—it's trust. Detailed performance requirements and strategies.

### 7. **Implementation Guidelines** (06)
How to approach building without prescribing specific technologies. Decision frameworks and evaluation criteria.

### 8. **Multi-App Architecture** (07)
Strategy for building an ecosystem where each app demonstrates agency restoration in different domains.

## Key Insights from Research & Philosophy

### The Agency Crisis
- **Modern paradox**: Systems too complex for those they serve
- **Defaulting epidemic**: People surrender choice from exhaustion
- **Our response**: Translation, not simplification
- **The promise**: "Stop guessing. Start knowing."

### Performance Reality
- **70% of users abandon** slow sites
- **<1s load time** is non-negotiable
- Modern metrics (INP) are harder to achieve
- Static-first architecture performs best

### Design Truth
- **25% better usability** with clear hierarchy (Apple)
- **20% fewer errors** with progressive disclosure (Material)
- **35% higher retention** with streamlined design (Linear)
- Functional beauty over aesthetic decoration

### Technical Landscape
- **Astro leads** for static site performance (90% less JS)
- **Service workers** enable offline-first experiences
- **Modern CSS** reduces JavaScript needs
- **Edge computing** brings content closer to users

### Content Reality
- **Maximum 2 clicks** to any information
- **7-second understanding** for main value prop
- Progressive complexity reveals depth
- Voice consistency builds trust

## Critical Success Factors

### What Makes This Different
1. **Philosophy-Driven**: Every decision reflects core beliefs
2. **Performance Obsessed**: Speed demonstrates competence
3. **Accessibility First**: Inclusive by design, not afterthought
4. **Globally Excellent**: Works everywhere, for everyone
5. **Future Proof**: Built to evolve, not rebuild

### What to Avoid
- Feature creep without purpose
- Complexity without benefit
- Beauty without function
- Speed without reliability
- Innovation without accessibility

## Your First Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack
Consider:
- Static site generators for performance
- Modern CSS for reduced complexity
- Progressive enhancement strategy
- PWA capabilities for offline
- Edge deployment for global speed

### 2. Design System
Establish:
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Performance-conscious components
- Accessibility-first patterns
- Progressive disclosure methods
- Responsive without complexity

### 3. Content Architecture
Define:
- Clear information hierarchy
- URL structure for future
- Navigation patterns
- Content types and templates
- SEO and performance balance

## Measuring Success

### Technical Metrics
- <1s load time globally
- 100/100 Lighthouse scores
- Zero errors in production
- <500KB initial bundle
- Offline capability after first visit

### User Metrics
- 7-second value understanding
- High task completion
- Low bounce rates
- Positive accessibility feedback
- Trust indicators improving

### Business Metrics
- Quality app downloads increasing
- Authority in AI space growing
- Developer applications rising
- Partnership inquiries incoming
- Brand recognition building

## The Challenge
Current websites in the VastSilicon family are fragmented, slow, and inconsistent. They have broken links, missing pages, confused navigation, and no unified vision. They're the opposite of "complexity translated."

More fundamentally: They don't demonstrate how we restore human agency in a world where complexity has outgrown human cognition.

## The Opportunity
Build a website that serves as proof of concept for VastSilicon's entire mission. Show that AI complexity can be made beautifully simple, instantly accessible, and universally valuable.

The website should feel like using our products: complexity handled invisibly, clarity delivered instantly, agency preserved throughout.

## Remember This Above All
You're not building a website. You're building a demonstration of philosophy. Every decision—from framework choice to font size—either proves we can translate complexity or admits we cannot.

The website is the first product. Make it worthy of the mission.

**The deeper truth**: We're building the cognitive infrastructure for the next century. This website should feel like a glimpse of that augmented future—where complexity serves humanity instead of overwhelming it.

**The test**: Does using our website restore agency the same way our products do?

## Next Steps
1. Read all documents in order
2. Evaluate technology options against principles
3. Create proof of concept for core pages
4. Test against all success metrics
5. Iterate based on real user feedback

## Final Thought
The best website is invisible—users remember what they learned, not how the site worked. Build infrastructure so excellent it disappears, leaving only understanding.
