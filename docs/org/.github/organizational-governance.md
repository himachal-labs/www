# Organizational Governance

## Repository Management

### Repository Structure Standards

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `mobile-app-ios`, `web-platform`
- Include platform/technology indicators when relevant
- Avoid abbreviations that lack context

**Repository Organization:**
- **Public Repositories**: Open source libraries, documentation, public-facing content
- **Private Repositories**: Product code, internal tools, sensitive configurations
- **Internal Repositories**: Shared resources within organization

### Access Management

**Permission Levels:**
- **Read**: External collaborators, documentation reviewers
- **Triage**: Issue management, project coordination
- **Write**: Active development team members
- **Maintain**: Repository administrators, senior developers
- **Admin**: Repository owners, organizational administrators

**Team-Based Access:**
- Create teams by function: `mobile-developers`, `web-team`, `documentation`
- Assign repository access to teams rather than individuals
- Review access quarterly and remove unused permissions

## Code Review Standards

### Pull Request Requirements

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- All code changes require pull request review
- Minimum one approval from team member with write access
- Automated tests must pass before merge
- Documentation updates included for user-facing changes

**Review Checklist:**
- Code quality and adherence to project standards
- Test coverage for new functionality
- Documentation accuracy and completeness
- Performance impact assessment
- Security considerations review

### Branch Protection Rules

**Main Branch Protection:**
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits pushed
- Require status checks to pass
- Restrict pushes to main branch
- Include administrators in restrictions

**Feature Branch Standards:**
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-validation`
- Keep branches focused on single feature or fix
- Delete merged branches to maintain repository cleanliness

## Issue and Project Management

### Issue Templates

**Bug Report Template:**
```markdown
**Description:**
Brief description of the bug

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Expected Behavior:**
What should happen

**Actual Behavior:**
What actually happens

**Environment:**
- Platform:
- Version:
- Browser (if applicable):

**Additional Context:**
Screenshots, logs, or other relevant information
```

**Feature Request Template:**
```markdown
**Feature Description:**
Clear description of the requested feature

**Use Case:**
Why is this feature needed?

**Proposed Solution:**
How should this feature work?

**Alternatives Considered:**
Other approaches considered

**Additional Context:**
Any other relevant information
```

### Project Planning

**Milestone Management:**
- Create milestones for major releases and feature sets
- Include completion criteria and target dates
- Track progress against established goals
- Regular milestone review and adjustment

**Label System:**
- `bug` - Confirmed issues requiring fixes
- `enhancement` - New features or improvements
- `documentation` - Documentation-related tasks
- `good-first-issue` - Suitable for new contributors
- `help-wanted` - External collaboration welcome
- `priority-high` - Urgent attention required

## Security and Compliance

### Sensitive Data Management

**Prohibited in Repositories:**
- API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens
- Personal or customer data
- Private configuration files
- Third-party credentials

**Required Practices:**
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement `.gitignore` patterns for sensitive files
- Regular secret scanning and rotation
- Encrypted storage for necessary credentials

### Dependency Management

**Security Standards:**
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Review security advisories for all dependencies
- Automated alerts for known vulnerabilities
- Document approved dependencies and versions

**License Compliance:**
- Maintain inventory of all third-party dependencies
- Verify license compatibility with project requirements
- Document license obligations and restrictions
- Regular compliance review and updates

## Documentation Standards

### Required Documentation

**Repository Level:**
- `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` file with appropriate licensing
- `CHANGELOG.md` for version history tracking

**Code Level:**
- Inline comments for complex logic
- API documentation for public interfaces
- Architecture decision records for significant choices
- Configuration documentation for deployment

### Documentation Maintenance

**Update Requirements:**
- Documentation updated with code changes
- Regular review for accuracy and completeness
- Version control for documentation changes
- Clear ownership and responsibility assignment

**Quality Standards:**
- Clear, concise writing without technical jargon
- Step-by-step procedures with expected outcomes
- Visual aids where helpful (diagrams, screenshots)
- Cross-references and navigation structure

## Compliance and Audit

### Regular Reviews

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Repository access and permission audit
- Dependency and security vulnerability assessment
- Documentation accuracy and completeness review
- Process effectiveness evaluation

**Annual Reviews:**
- Organizational structure and team alignment
- Technology stack and architectural decisions
- Security policies and procedures
- Training and knowledge management needs

### Record Keeping

**Required Records:**
- Access changes and permission modifications
- Security incidents and response actions
- Major architectural and technology decisions
- Training completion and certification tracking

**Retention Policies:**
- Maintain audit logs for minimum required periods
- Archive historical project data appropriately
- Regular backup verification and recovery testing
- Clear data retention and deletion procedures
