# Implementation Guidelines

## Implementation Philosophy
Start with why, design with what, build with how. Technology serves purpose.

**The deeper principle**: We're building the sensory organ humanity needs for the information age. Every implementation choice should ask: "Does this help humans navigate complexity better?"

## Decision Framework

### For Every Technical Choice, Evaluate:

1. **Philosophy Alignment**
   - Does it demonstrate complexity translation?
   - Does it enhance user understanding?
   - Does it build trust through reliability?
   - Does it reduce the cognitive cost of choice?
   - Does it preserve user agency while augmenting capability?

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Bundle size contribution
   - Runtime performance cost  
   - Build time implications
   - Global delivery efficiency

3. **Maintenance Reality**
   - Team knowledge requirements
   - Upgrade path complexity
   - Community health
   - Escape routes available

4. **User Experience**
   - Accessibility impact
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Offline capability
   - Error resilience

## Technology Selection Principles

### Build Tool Considerations
**Optimize for:**
- Fast local development (instant feedback)
- Reliable production builds (no surprises)
- Asset optimization automation
- Clear error messages
- Incremental adoption

**Warning signs:**
- Complex configuration
- Slow build times
- Poor error messages
- Breaking changes frequent
- Small community

### Framework Philosophy
**Static-first mindset**: Generate HTML at build time whenever possible—mirroring how we pre-translate complexity for users.

**Consider static generators when:**
- Content changes infrequently
- SEO is critical (discoverability = accessibility)
- Performance is paramount (speed = reduced cognitive cost)
- Offline matters (resilience = trust)
- Simplicity preferred (boring tech, interesting outcomes)

**Consider hybrid solutions when:**
- Some dynamic features needed
- Personalization required
- Real-time data integration
- Complex interactions
- Team has specific expertise

### CSS Architecture Approach

**Principles over tools:**
- Consistency through systems
- Performance through optimization
- Maintainability through clarity
- Flexibility through foundations

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Bundle size impact
- Team velocity
- Design system compatibility
- Performance cost
- Long-term maintainability

### JavaScript Strategy

**Enhancement layers** (mirrors our product philosophy):
1. **Core**: Works without JavaScript (base agency)
2. **Enhanced**: Better with JavaScript (augmented capability)
3. **Optimal**: Best with modern JavaScript (full cognitive enhancement)

**The principle**: Like ChoiceCheck, users should have value even without enhancement, but with it, they think better.

**Per-component evaluation:**
- Could this be CSS?
- Could this be HTML?
- Is JavaScript essential?
- What's the fallback?
- What's the bundle cost?

## Development Workflow

### Local Development Requirements
- **Instant startup**: <3s to running
- **Fast refresh**: <100ms to see changes
- **Clear errors**: Know what's wrong
- **Production parity**: Local matches deployed
- **Accessible tooling**: All team members

### Quality Assurance Integration

**Automated checks:**
- Performance budgets
- Accessibility scores
- SEO validation
- Build success
- Link integrity

**Manual verification:**
- Cross-browser testing
- Device variety
- Network conditions
- User journey completion
- Error scenarios

### Deployment Strategy

**Requirements:**
- Zero-downtime deploys
- Instant rollback capability
- Preview environments
- Global CDN distribution
- Atomic deploys

**Nice to have:**
- Branch previews
- A/B testing capability
- Geographic routing
- Edge computing
- Analytics integration

## Component Development

### Component Philosophy
- **Single responsibility**: One component, one job (clarity principle)
- **Composability**: Build complex from simple (translation in action)
- **Accessibility built-in**: Not added later (human right, not feature)
- **Performance conscious**: Measure impact (every ms counts)
- **Documentation**: Self-evident usage (complexity pre-translated)

### State Management
- **URL as state**: Shareable, bookmarkable
- **Local when possible**: Avoid complexity
- **Server-rendered**: Initial state in HTML
- **Progressive**: Enhance don't require
- **Resilient**: Handle all states

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Always have fallback
- **User-friendly messages**: Guide to solution
- **Recovery paths**: Never dead ends
- **Logging strategy**: Debug without exposing
- **Offline awareness**: Handle connection loss

## Testing Philosophy

### Testing Priorities
1. **User journeys**: Critical paths work (agency preservation)
2. **Accessibility**: Automated where possible (universal augmentation)
3. **Performance**: Budget enforcement (cognitive cost control)
4. **Visual regression**: Catch unintended changes (trust through consistency)
5. **Error scenarios**: Graceful failures (resilient augmentation)

**The test**: Does every test scenario ask "Does this preserve and enhance user agency?"

### Testing Anti-patterns
- Testing implementation over behavior
- Brittle selectors
- Slow test suites
- Flaky tests ignored
- Coverage over quality

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- **Why over what**: Explain decisions
- **Examples over description**: Show usage
- **Maintenance notes**: Future developer help
- **Performance implications**: Note costs
- **Accessibility requirements**: Built-in guidance

### Project Documentation
- **Quick start**: <5 minutes to contributing
- **Architecture decisions**: Why choices made
- **Common tasks**: How-to guides
- **Troubleshooting**: Known issues
- **Performance tips**: Optimization guide

## The Implementation Test

Before implementing any feature, ask:
1. Does this serve our philosophy? (complexity translation)
2. What's the simplest solution? (cognitive load reduction)
3. How does this affect performance? (time cost of choice)
4. Is this accessible to everyone? (augmentation as right)
5. Will this scale globally? (universal human need)

**The agency test**: Does this feature increase user control or decrease it? We augment, never automate.

## Remember
Implementation is where philosophy becomes reality. Every line of code either demonstrates our ability to translate complexity or contradicts it.

Choose boring technology. Do interesting things with it. The goal is invisible infrastructure that enables visible impact.

We're not building a website. We're building proof that complexity can serve humanity.

**The north star**: In 100 years, will the principles we establish now still be helping humans navigate complexity? Build for that timeline. The specific technologies will change; the need for cognitive augmentation will only grow.

**The final test**: Someone using our website should feel what it's like to have a "trusted companion for thought"—before they even download an app.
