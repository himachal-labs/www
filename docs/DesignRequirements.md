## Visual Principles
1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Every element should enhance understanding
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed
3. **Quiet Confidence**: Let the work speak, not the design
4. **Functional Beauty**: Aesthetics that serve purpose

## Color Philosophy
- Primary: Deep, trustworthy
- Accent: Energetic but not loud
- Background: Clean whites with subtle depth
- Text: High contrast, perfect readability

## Typography
- Headers: Modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- Body: Optimized for reading
- Code: Monospace that feels approachable

## Interaction Patterns
- **Instant Response**: Every interaction should feel immediate
- **Subtle Animations**: Motion that guides, not distracts
- **Clear Affordances**: Users should never wonder what's clickable
- **Graceful Degradation**: Beautiful at every breakpoint

## Content Architecture
1. **Hero**: Vision in one sentence
2. **Problem**: Why this matters now
3. **Solution**: Our approach (not features)
4. **Products**: Glimpses of the future
5. **Impact**: The world we're building
6. **Action**: Clear next step

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance First**: <1s load time is non-negotiable
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA where possible
- **SEO**: Structure for discoverability
- **Analytics**: Measure what matters
